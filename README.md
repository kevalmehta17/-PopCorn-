**Popcorn** is a React-based movie search application that allows users to:

- **Search for Movies**: Enter a movie title in the search bar to find your favorite movies.
- **View Movie Details**: Click on any movie in the search results to view detailed information such as the plot, cast, and ratings.
- **Manage a Watchlist**: Add movies to your watchlist so you can keep track of what you want to watch. Easily remove movies from the watchlist when you're done watching.

This app is a project developed and designed to practice key React concepts such as state management, side effects with `useEffect`, and custom hooks.
